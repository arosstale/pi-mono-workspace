# OpenClaw V2.5 - ALMA Self-Improving Systems

> **Vision**: Agentic systems that learn to improve all aspects of their agentic system, including their memory, learning to continually learn while solving problems in ever-changing real-world environments.

## What's New in V2.5

### 1. ALMA Meta-Learning Agent 🆕

Based on the ALMA research paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07755):

**Key Innovation**: AI systems should learn **HOW to optimize**, not just **WHAT to execute**.

#### Features

- **Design Proposal**: Mutates existing memory designs or creates random ones
- **Evaluation**: Measures performance (accuracy, efficiency, compression)
- **Archive**: Stores designs with scores
- **Iteration**: Continuously improves through mutations
- **Best Design Tracking**: Always uses the highest-scoring design

#### Advanced Capabilities (New in Enhanced V2.5)

- **Real Evaluator**: Uses actual memory performance metrics instead of mocks.
- **Advanced Mutations**: Gaussian, Simulated Annealing, Crossover, and Adaptive strategies.
- **V7 Integration**: Dedicated script (`alma_v7_integration.py`) to apply ALMA to trading strategies.

### 2. Knowledge System (New) 🆕

A semantic search engine for the agent's own codebase.

- **Indexer**: Indexes code files for retrieval.
- **Searcher**: Finds relevant code snippets based on queries.
- **Registry**: Central component management system.

### 3. ALMA+PAOM Integration 🆕

**Combines**:
- **ALMA**: Discovers optimal memory designs
- **PAOM**: Implements memory design
- **Loop**: ALMA proposes → PAOM implements → ALMA evaluates → Repeat

#### Self-Improving System

```python
from alma_paom_integration import ALMAPAOSystem

# Initialize self-improving system
system = ALMAPAOSystem()

# Run meta-learning cycle
designs = system.run_meta_learning_cycle(
    num_iterations=5,
    num_designs_per_iteration=3,
)

# Best design is automatically applied
best_design = system.alma.get_best_design()
```

### Self-Improving Roadmap 🆕

Comprehensive roadmap for building fully self-improving AI systems:

#### Phase 1: Core Self-Improvement ✅ (COMPLETE)
- V2.5: ALMA+PAOM integration
- Meta-learning for memory designs
- Automatic optimization

#### Phase 2: Real-World Evaluation (IN PROGRESS)
- Deploy to production V7 trading system
- Collect real performance metrics
- Iterate on designs

#### Phase 3: Multi-Agent Meta-Learning (PLANNED)
- Extend ALMA to multi-agent systems
- Learn optimal agent routing
- Tick Orchestrator integration

#### Phase 4: Continual Learning (PLANNED)
- Online learning from interactions
- Real-time design updates
- No training/inference split

#### Phase 5: Self-Improving Architecture (PLANNED)
- Full self-improving AI system
- Learns to improve all aspects:
  - Memory (PAOM + ALMA)
  - Agent routing (Tick)
  - Strategy selection (V7)
  - Tool usage (RBI)
- Autonomous evolution
- Zero human intervention
