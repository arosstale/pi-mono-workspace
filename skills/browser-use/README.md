# browser-use Skill

Natural language browser automation - no Playwright scripts needed.

---

## Quick Start

Instead of writing code, just describe what you want:

> "Go to Reddit r/openclaw and extract the top post title and upvotes"

The AI figures out:
- Which URL to navigate to
- Which elements to click
- How to extract the data
- How to handle errors

## Why It Matters

| Traditional | browser-use |
|-------------|--------------|
| Hours of coding | Minutes |
| Fragile (breaks on updates) | Adapts to changes |
| Debug DOM selectors | Natural language |
| Requires coding skill | Anyone can use |
