# Sales Outreach — OpenClaw Platform

## Target: Agencies Running Discord Lead Gen

---

## Email Sequence

### Email 1: The Problem

**Subject:** Your Discord agents are locked into one LLM

> Hey [Name],
>
> Saw you're running Discord lead-gen with AI agents. Quick question:
>
> What happens when Claude has an outage? Or raises prices? Or changes terms?
>
> You're locked in.
>
> OpenClaw runs 100+ LLM providers. Claude goes down? Switch to Groq instantly. No code changes.
>
> Same agents. Same workflows. 100x more reliable.
>
> Worth a 5-min demo?
>
> [Calendar Link]

### Email 2: The Multi-Provider Advantage

**Subject:** Run everything, not just Claude

> Hey [Name],
>
> Most agencies I talk to are locked into a single LLM provider for their Discord agents.
>
> Here's what they're missing:
>
> • **Cost optimization:** Route simple tasks to cheaper models (Haiku: $0.25/M vs Opus: $15/M)
> • **Reliability:** If one provider fails, agents failover automatically
> • **Performance:** Use best model for each task (Claude for reasoning, Groq for speed)
> • **No lock-in:** Switch providers without rewriting agent code
>
> OpenClaw is the platform that makes this possible.
>
> We're not the product — we're the infrastructure. Can't acquire 100 contributors.
>
> Interested in seeing how this works for your use case?

### Email 3: The Infrastructure Pitch

**Subject:** Platform vs. Product

> Hey [Name],
>
> There's a difference between using a tool and owning your infrastructure.
>
> **Tools** (Claude Code, single-vendor agents):
> • Work until they don't
> • Price hikes hurt
> • Outages kill your business
> • Can't customize
>
> **Platform** (OpenClaw):
> • 100+ providers, your choice
> • White-label ready ($299/mo)
> • Community-owned, impossible to kill
> • Full control
>
> We're building the Linux of agent orchestration.
>
> Your move: tools or infrastructure?
>
> [Book a call]

## Closing Script

**When they say "We're happy with our current setup":**

> "Totally get it. One question: what's your plan when [current vendor] raises prices 3x? Or has a 6-hour outage during your peak campaign?>
>
> OpenClaw isn't about replacing what works. It's about having options when things break.>
>
> We're the insurance policy you didn't know you needed."

---

**When they say "We're a small agency, enterprise features don't matter":**

> "That's exactly why multi-provider matters. Big agencies can absorb vendor price hikes. Small agencies get crushed.>
>
> OpenClaw Professional is $299/mo. One vendor outage costs you more than that in lost leads.>
>
> Scale up, scale down. You're in control."

---

## Objection Handling

**"Open source = less secure"**

> "Community-owned is MORE secure. 100+ contributors audit the code. Closed-source = trust us. Open-source = verify.>
>
> Plus: you choose hosted (us) or self-hosted (you). Your data, your control."

---

**"We don't have time to migrate"**

> "Migration takes 1 day. Lock-in costs you forever.>
>
> We'll handle the migration. You keep running your agents. Zero downtime."

---

**"What's the ROI?"**

> "Three ways:>
> 1. Cost: 60-90% cheaper model routing ($500/mo → $50/mo)>
> 2. Reliability: Zero downtime during vendor outages>
> 3. Flexibility: Use best model for each task, not one-size-fits-all>
>
> Most agencies see ROI in month 1."
