## Sales Messaging

### vs. JARVIS/MissionDeck (Generic)

**Prospect says:** "Why not just use MissionDeck? It's free and has a dashboard."

**Your response:**
"MissionDeck is great for generic agent orchestration — like using a spreadsheet for CRM. It works, but it's not built for your specific workflow.

We're not just orchestrating agents. We're generating qualified leads for BYD/automation deals in Italy. Our system:

- Speaks Italian (not just English)
- Knows BYD's Italy operations (we have case studies)
- Targets automotive/industrial verticals specifically
- Qualifies leads by budget/urgency (not just tasks)
- Hands you hot deals to close (not just todos)

MissionDeck helps you manage work. We bring you revenue."

### vs. Generic AI Agencies

**Prospect says:** "We already work with an AI agency."

**Your response:**
"Most agencies build chatbots or marketing automation. We do operations automation that saves €100k+/year.

Difference:
- They do front-end (customer chat)
- We do back-end (fleet management, factory automation, dealer operations)
- They charge hourly
- We charge for results (audits, implementations, platforms)
- They use generic tools
- We use OpenClaw + your specific BYD/integration context

Ask your current agency: 'What's your experience with BYD fleet automation in Italy?' If they don't have case studies, they can't deliver what we can."

### vs. Doing It In-House

**Prospect says:** "We'll just build this ourselves with MissionDeck."

**Your response:**
"You absolutely can. MissionDeck is open source. But consider:

**Time to market:**
- DIY: 3-6 months to learn, build, debug
- Us: Live in 1 week with your tokens

**Vertical expertise:**
- DIY: Generic agent skills
- Us: BYD-specific RAG, Italian market knowledge, automotive playbook

**Opportunity cost:**
- DIY: Your team building infrastructure
- Us: Your team closing deals while we run lead-gen

We're not selling software. We're selling **3 months of your time + 50 qualified leads** in week 1."

## Value Prop Matrix

| Buyer | Pain | JARVIS/MissionDeck | Artale |
|-------|------|-------------------|--------|
| **CTO** | Need to manage AI projects | Task tracking dashboard | Revenue-generating pipeline |
| **Ops Manager** | Factory inefficiencies | Generic automation | BYD-certified industrial AI |
| **Sales Director** | Not enough leads | N/A (not a sales tool) | Qualified lead machine |
| **BYD Dealer** | Fleet management chaos | Generic tools | BYD-specific automation |

## Positioning Statement

**For:** Italian automotive/industrial operations managers  
**Who:** Need qualified leads for BYD/automation deals  
**Artale is a:** 3-agent AI lead generation system  
**That:** Hunts, qualifies, and delivers hot prospects  
**Unlike:** Generic agent orchestration platforms (JARVIS/MissionDeck)  
**We:** Specialize in Italy market, BYD expertise, and revenue outcomes  

## Battle Cards

### JARVIS: "It's free and open source"
**Counter:** "Free to start, expensive to customize. We include vertical-specific RAG and Italian localization — that would take you months to build."

### JARVIS: "Has a nice dashboard"
**Counter:** "Dashboards don't close deals. Our system hands you qualified leads with context — company, budget, urgency. You close, we automate."

### JARVIS: "Built by Asif Rahman (well-known)"
**Counter:** "Built for generic use cases. We're built for YOUR use case — Italian automotive/automation. Different market, different expertise."

### JARVIS: "Has Telegram integration"
**Counter:** "So do we. Plus Discord, LinkedIn, email, WhatsApp. And we qualify leads before sending — not just notifications."

## When to Position Against JARVIS

**DO position against them when:**
- Prospect is technical (knows OpenClaw ecosystem)
- They've tried generic tools and failed
- They need Italy-specific expertise
- They care about revenue, not just efficiency

**DON'T position against them when:**
- Prospect just needs task management
- They're pre-revenue (not ready for lead-gen)
- They want a quick dashboard for internal use
- They're comparing on price alone (they'll go free)

## Closing Argument

"JARVIS is a Toyota — reliable, generic, gets you from A to B.

We're a Ferrari tuned for the Italian automotive market — built for speed, precision, and winning races.

Both have engines. One wins championships."
