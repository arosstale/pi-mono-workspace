## 📚 The 4 Lecture Series

### 1. Financial Mathematics - MIT
**Duration:** 24 videos (20+ hours)
**Instructor:** MIT Faculty
**Course URL:** [Search YouTube: "MIT Financial Mathematics"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=MIT+Financial+Mathematics)

**What it covers:**
This is the foundation. Pure mathematics applied to finance.

**Topics:**
- Introduction to financial terms and concepts
- Linear algebra for portfolio optimization
- Probability theory and stochastic processes
- Regression analysis and time series
- Volatility modeling
- Risk models and derivatives pricing

**Study Approach:**
This isn't a YouTube course with flashy graphics. It's a real MIT lecture. Professors write equations on whiteboards.

> **Important:** You'll need to pause, rewind, and take notes. But the depth is worth it.

**Prerequisites:** None (start here)

---

### 2. Financial Theory - Yale University
**Duration:** 26 videos (26 hours)
**Instructor:** Yale Faculty
**Course URL:** [Search YouTube: "Yale Financial Theory"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Yale+Financial+Theory)

**What it covers:**
26 videos over a full semester reviewing key statistical concepts in finance.

**Topics:**
- Portfolio diversification
- Efficient Frontier
- Arbitrage pricing theory
- Quantifying uncertainty and risk

**The Catch:**
It's a bit outdated. The lectures were recorded in 2014. Some references feel old.

**Why It's Still Valuable:**
Core concepts such as portfolio theory, arbitrage pricing, and risk management are **timeless**.

**Study Approach:**
Focus on the concepts, not the dates. The math hasn't changed.

**Prerequisites:** MIT Financial Mathematics (recommended)

---

### 3. Quantitative Trading Strategies - Oxford University
**Instructor:** Liu Peng, Oxford
**Duration:** 34 videos (hands-on)
**Course URL:** [Search YouTube: "Liu Peng Oxford Quantitative Trading"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Liu+Peng+Oxford+Quantitative+Trading)

**What it covers:**
This is the most hands-on series on the list. Focuses on different quantitative trading strategy types and their implementation.

**Topics:**
- Financial data sourcing, cleaning, and visualization
- Order types and execution strategies
  - Market orders
  - Limit orders
  - Stop orders
- Risk and return calculation
- Python programming basics for trading

**The Catch:**
It assumes you already understand probability and basic statistics. If you jump straight into this without foundation, you'll miss context.

**Study Approach:**
If you've done the groundwork (MIT + Yale), this can be helpful. Focus on the Python implementation parts.

**Prerequisites:** MIT Financial Mathematics + Yale Financial Theory

### 4. Price Momentum - Columbia Business School
**Instructor:** Kent Daniel
**Duration:** 2 singular lectures (5 hours)
**Course URL:** [Search YouTube: "Kent Daniel Price Momentum Columbia"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Kent+Daniel+Price+Momentum+Columbia)

**What it covers:**
Two singular lectures that serve as an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand or develop a momentum strategy.

**Topics:**
- Why momentum works (behavioral finance perspective)
- How to construct momentum portfolios
- Cross-sectional vs. time-series momentum
- Risk factors and portfolio construction

**Why It's Valuable:**
Momentum is one of the most robust strategies in quantitative trading. It's been documented for decades. These lectures explain why it works and how to implement it properly.

Kent Daniel is a professor at Columbia Business School and one of the leading researchers on momentum.

**Study Approach:**
He doesn't just recite theory—he shows you the data. Watch the examples carefully.

**Prerequisites:** MIT Financial Mathematics + Yale Financial Theory + Oxford Quant Strategies

## 💡 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't:
- Bookmark lectures and "watch later" (you never will)
- Jump between series without finishing one
- Skip the math parts (you'll miss the foundation)
- Only watch, don't take notes (you'll forget)
- Try to implement without understanding theory

### ✅ Do:
- Treat it like a real university course
- Schedule specific times (e.g., Sundays 2-5 PM)
- Pause and rewind when confused
- Write down formulas and concepts
- Implement immediately after learning
