## Demo: Complete Intelligence Pipeline

**Task:** "Analyze this crypto project for investment"

### Step 1: Content Extraction (fabric-patterns)
- Extract whitepaper, tokenomics, team info
- Structure: SUMMARY, IDEAS, INSIGHTS, RISKS

### Step 2: Multi-Model Consensus (ai-swarm)
- Query 4 models: Investment thesis analysis
- Consensus check: Bullish/Bearish/Neutral
- Confidence score: 85%+

### Step 3: Market Context (whale-watcher)
- Check smart money flows in sector
- Whale accumulation/distribution signals
- Liquidation levels

### Step 4: Code Audit (bug-scanner)
- If open source: Scan contracts for bugs
- Security patterns check

### Step 5: Security Review (security-review)
- OWASP check on web app
- Secrets detection in repos

### Step 6: Cost Optimization (cost-pipeline)
- Route analysis to Haiku (cheap)
- Escalate to Opus only for complex valuation

### Output: Investment Intelligence Report

**Status:** Pipeline designed, ready to deploy.

## Use Cases
