## Email 1 — AI Builder Discord Agencies

**To:** Founders running Discord lead-gen agencies
**Subject:** Your Discord agents are locked into Claude

Hey [Name],

Saw your post in AI Builder about scaling Discord outreach with Claude agents.

One risk: single-vendor lock-in.

What happens when:
- Claude has an outage during your peak campaign?
- Prices increase 3x (happened with GPT-4)?
- API limits throttle your outreach?

**OpenClaw runs 100+ LLM providers.** Claude goes down? Switch to Groq in 30 seconds. Same agents. Same workflows. Zero code changes.

We're not the product — we're the infrastructure. Can't acquire 100 contributors.

**Worth a 5-min demo?** [Book time](link)

## Email 2 — AutoGen/LangChain Users

**To:** Developers building with AutoGen or LangGraph
**Subject:** Escape vendor lock-in with multi-provider agents

Hey [Name],

Building agents with AutoGen/LangChain? You're locked into their ecosystem.

**The problem:**
- AutoGen = Microsoft-controlled, Claude-only
- LangGraph = LangChain-owned, complex pricing
- Both: vendor lock-in, no white-label

**OpenClaw:**
- 100+ providers (Claude, Groq, Cerebras, DeepSeek, Gemini)
- White-label for $299/mo (your brand, not ours)
- Community-owned (100 contributors, impossible to kill)

**Case study:** One agency switched from AutoGen to OpenClaw, reduced costs 60%, added white-label, now reselling to clients.

Interested in seeing how migration works?

## Email 3 — Claude Code Power Users

**To:** Heavy Claude Code users
**Subject:** Claude Code runs Claude. OpenClaw runs everything.

Hey [Name],

Using Claude Code for development? Great tool — for Claude-only workflows.

**Limitations:**
- No multi-provider failover
- No white-label option
- No Discord/WhatsApp/Slack integration
- Microsoft-owned, closed source

**OpenClaw adds:**
- Multi-provider (Claude + Groq + Cerebras + 100s)
- White-label agents ($299/mo)
- Native messaging (Discord, Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp)
- Community-owned infrastructure

**Same agent patterns. More providers. Your brand.**

Worth exploring? I can show you side-by-side comparison.

## LinkedIn Post 1 — Risk Narrative

Single LLM provider = single point of failure.

Last week: Claude had a 2-hour outage.
Agencies running Discord lead-gen? Dead in the water.

OpenClaw users? Switched to Groq automatically. Outreach continued.

Multi-provider isn't luxury. It's insurance.

Infrastructure > Tool lock-in.

## LinkedIn Post 2 — Cost Comparison

Agency running Discord agents:

Claude Opus: $15/M tokens
Haiku: $0.25/M tokens

Same task. 60x cheaper.

Smart routing = 60-90% cost reduction.

One agency saved $2,400/mo by routing simple tasks to cheaper models.

That's 12 months of OpenClaw Professional ($299/mo) paid by month 1.

## LinkedIn Post 3 — White-Label

Your agency. Your clients. Your brand.

OpenClaw Professional ($299/mo):
- White-label Discord agents
- Custom domains
- Your logo everywhere
- You sell it, we power it

Your clients see YOUR product.
Not "powered by OpenClaw."
Not "built with Claude."

Just your brand, working.

Infrastructure that disappears.

## Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3:** Case study
> "One agency migrated from single-vendor to OpenClaw. Results: 60% cost reduction, zero downtime during outages, white-label revenue stream. Full case study: [link]"

**Day 7:** Technical deep dive
> "How multi-provider failover works: [diagram]. When Provider A fails, requests automatically route to Provider B in <100ms. No code changes. No downtime."

**Day 14:** Final check
> "Still evaluating options? One question I can answer to help with the decision?"
