## 📝 Blog Post

**Title:** How I Saved 400 Hours/Year by Automating Trade Show Lead Generation

**Excerpt:** Stop spending your weekends scraping exhibitor lists. Here's how to get qualified leads delivered to WhatsApp every morning.

---

**Introduction**

Last February, I attended Winter FancyFaire. I came back with:

• A phone full of photos
• A stack of business cards
• 3 PDFs of exhibitor lists
• A promise to follow up with everyone

Fast forward 3 months.

• I had contacted 1,200 leads
• Response rate: 12%
• Deals closed: 4
• Hours spent: 96

**96 hours for 4 deals.**

That's when I realized: **There has to be a better way.**

---

**The Problem with Manual Lead Gen**

Trade shows are gold mines for leads. But extracting them is a nightmare:

1. **Scattered Data**
   - Expo West: PDF
   - FancyFaire: Website
   - CES: Mobile app
   - NRF: Excel sheet

2. **Manual Entry**
   - Copy/paste into CRM
   - Verify emails one by one
   - Find websites manually
   - Classify industries

3. **Quality Issues**
   - 30% invalid emails
   - Missing contact info
   - Duplicate entries
   - Outdated data

**Result:** You spend 8+ hours per week on lead gen. And by Friday, your leads are already outdated.

---

**The Solution: Automated Lead Gen**

I built **Lead Generation Claw** — a pre-configured AI agent that:

1. **Scrapes** trade shows automatically
2. **Enriches** every lead
3. **Qualifies** based on your criteria
4. **Delivers** to WhatsApp daily

**Setup time: 10 minutes.**

---

**How It Works**

### Phase 1: Scraping

Connect 7+ trade show platforms:

• SmallWorldLabs
• Swapcard
• Map Your Show
• Cvent
• Eventbrite
• A2Z/Personify
• Bizzabo

Some need API keys. Most work out of the box.

**Example:** Expo West 2026 has 3,144 exhibitors.

Lead Gen Claw scrapes all of them in 5 minutes.

### Phase 2: Enrichment

Every lead gets enriched:

• **Website** — Verifies the URL is live
• **Email** — SMTP validation (85%+ deliverability)
• **Industry** — AI classifies (Food, Beverage, Retail)
• **Social Media** — Finds LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram
• **Company Size** — Estimates employee count

**Result:** 2,847 high-quality leads with verified data.

### Phase 3: Qualification

AI scores every lead (0-100) based on your criteria:

• Industry: [Food, Beverage, Retail]
• Company size: [Small, Medium, Large]
• Location: [US, Canada, Europe]
• Contact quality: [Email, Phone, Title]

**Your config:**
```json
{
  "min_score": 50,
  "industries": ["food", "beverage"],
  "company_size": ["medium", "large"]
}
```

**Result:** 2,847 raw leads → 2,847 qualified leads.

### Phase 4: Export

Multiple formats for every use case:

• **CSV** — Import into HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce
• **Excel** — Filter, sort, analyze in spreadsheet
• **SQLite** — Power custom apps and dashboards

### Phase 5: Delivery

Wake up to leads in your inbox:

**WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack:**
